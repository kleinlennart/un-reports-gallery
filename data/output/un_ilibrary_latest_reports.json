    "summary":"<p>The 2025 Global AIDS Update, AIDS, Crisis and the Power to Transform, shows that a historic funding crisis is threatening to unravel decades of progress unless countries can make radical shifts to HIV programming and funding. The report highlights the impact that the sudden, large-scale funding cuts from international donors are having on countries most affected by HIV. Yet it also showcases some inspiring examples of resilience, with countries and communities stepping up in the face of adversity to protect the gains made and drive the HIV response forward.<\/p>",

    "summary":"<p>Ethiopia is a country of origin and transit, with migration primarily occurring around three main routes: (a) Eastern route through Djibouti towards Saudi Arabia; (b) Southern route through Kenya towards South Africa; and (c) Northern route through Libya towards Europe. In 2022, the number of unaccompanied children who migrated via the Eastern route doubled in comparison to 2021, and unaccompanied children made up 38 per cent of all children on the move from Ethiopia in 2022. En route, children may face protection risks including arbitrary arrest and detention, human trafficking for the purposes of labour or sexual exploitation, gender-based violence, extortion and denial of access to basic needs. Broad structural factors, such as conflict, drought and poverty are driving children and adults to migrate despite the protection risks. To understand the current knowledge gaps in the nexus between migration and child protection, as well as proposed improvements, this study relies on primary and secondary data analysis. With a particular focus on exploring linkages between child migration and trafficking in children in Ethiopia, the report concludes with the institutional and legal landscape for children on the move and highlights key policy gaps in protecting children on the move across Ethiopia.<\/p>",

Given the country&#8217;s aridity, water scarcity, and vulnerability to climate-induced hazards&#8212;exacerbated by conflict&#8212;this study provides an evidence-based foundation for policy discussions and interventions. Utilizing qualitative mixed methods, including key informant interviews and focus group discussions, the report highlights how extreme weather events (floods, cyclones, wildfires, dust storms) and slow-onset environmental changes (drought, rising temperatures, soil degradation, and sea level rise) drive displacement, alter livelihoods, and exacerbate vulnerabilities. The findings underscore adaptive responses&#8212;such as makeshift repairs and community support&#8212;that remain insufficient amid Yemen&#8217;s humanitarian crisis. The report also examines migration dynamics, revealing how conflict, economic instability, and environmental degradation fuel internal displacement and migration through Yemen toward neighboring countries. Key challenges identified include governance gaps, resource scarcity, gender disparities, and deteriorating health and security conditions, making urgent policy action essential.<\/p>",

The warming trend between 1991&#8211;2024 was almost double that during the 1961&#8211;1990 period. In 2024, heatwaves gripped a record area of the ocean. Sea surface temperatures were the highest on record, with Asia&#8217;s sea surface decadal warming rate nearly double the global average. Sea level rise on the Pacific and Indian Ocean sides of the continent exceeded the global average, heightening risks for low-lying coastal areas. Reduced winter snowfall and extreme summer heat were punishing for glaciers. In the central Himalayas and Tian Shan. 23 out of 24 glaciers suffered mass loss, leading to an increase in hazards like glacial lake outburst floods and landslides and long-term risks for water security. Extreme rainfall wreaked havoc and heavy casualties in many countries in the region, and tropical cyclones left a trail of destruction, whilst drought caused heavy economic and agricultural losses. The report included a case study from Nepal, showing how strengthened early warning systems and anticipatory action enable communities to prepare for and respond to climate variability and change, thereby helping to protect lives and livelihoods. The State of the Climate reports are flagship reports of WMO and provide policy-relevant information for national and regional decision-making.<\/p>",

However, the benefits of the digital economy are unevenly spread; there is a large digital divide. It is caused by infrastructure gaps, skills gaps, and services gaps. Bridging these gaps requires significant investment and private sector development. Promoting international investment by digital MNEs can support digital development. UNCTAD&#8217;s World Investment Report 2017 first looked at the implications of the digital economy for international investment and investment policy. Since that report, the relevance of digital-economy foreign direct investment (FDI) has increased significantly. Digital technologies have continued to advance. Investment policies connected to digitalization have also moved on. And, importantly, the United Nations adopted a new Digital Compact in 2024 with the objective to help developing countries bridge the digital divide. World Investment Report 2025 aims to explore the latest trends of international investment in digital economy, analyze the drivers and determinants, assess their impact on sustainable development, as well as analyze how investment policy can support digital economy, and provide relevant policy recommendations.<\/p>",

    "summary":"<p>Early in the children and armed conflict (CAAC) agenda, the Denial of Humanitarian Access (DHA) to children was identified as a critical issue affecting children in conflict areas and other situations of violence. Over the years, cases of the DHA, as reported through MRM, on grave violations against children in situations of armed conflict have been steadily on the rise. DHA is one of the six grave violations the United Nations is monitoring through the Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) as established by the Security Council resolution 1612 (2005). Between 2005 and 2024, more than 30,000 DHA incidents have been verified. DHA, as defined within the CAAC agenda, and as specified in this document, does not exist in a vacuum but is informed by a comprehensive body of international legal norms and standards designed to protect the rights and well-being of children in times of conflict, including international humanitarian law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This Guidance Note results from extensive consultations with field staff and partners involved in the MRM. This document provides specific and practical guidance to field colleagues involved in MRM implementation. It helps identify incidents to be verified through the monitoring and reporting of DHA violations, including attribution as mandated by the Security Council. The guidance is to ensure coherence and consistency in verifying and reporting on DHA within the CAAC agenda. It endeavours to devise a global approach that is applicable across all situations of concern on the CAAC agenda while concurrently recognizing and accommodating the specificities inherent to each unique context.<\/p>",

    "summary":"<p>The Compilation Guidelines for Measurement of Gender-in-Trade Statistics were prepared by UNCTAD for further refinement and application in country pilot studies to assess data availability and gaps, and to compile experimental gender-in-trade indicators. The compilation guidelines reflect on the findings of a pilot carried out in Georgia, and later repeated in Kazakhstan. The guidelines were produced as part of the joint UNCTAD-ECA-ECE United Nations Development Account project &#8220;Data and statistics for more gender-responsive trade policies in Africa, the Caucasus, and Central Asia\" and are intended to be put to test by any country interested to assess data availability and develop new indicators by reusing data and statistics to provide new insights for a more informed and gender-responsive trade policy. These guidelines will be subject to further refinement and extensions based on the work of countries and other international organizations.<\/p>",

    "summary":"<p>Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are an ever-popular policy tool for the promotion of investment, employment generation, and the stimulation of innovation. Current estimates suggest that there are around 240 SEZs in Africa alone, with the total number worldwide passing 5,000. While traditionally, SEZ policies have focused on the attraction of foreign large-scale industrial investors, there has been an increasing interest on how to leverage SEZ policies to support local firms, in particular micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMES) and foster local entrepreneurship. The importance of MSMEs and entrepreneurship for economic and social outcomes has been extensively documented. In most economies, MSMEs represent the vast majority of firms, in particular in the developing world. They contribute to the lion share of formal and informal employment and typically grow faster than large established companies. The entry of new firms has been shown to promote productivity and value added. However, MSMEs also encounter particular challenges. Among other, they face higher hurdles to access finance, struggle more with bureaucratic processes, and often have lower managerial and technological capabilities. These difficulties make it even more challenging for them to realize market opportunities and their growth potential.<\/p>",

    "summary":"<p>In 2025, the global fertility rate is making headlines. In many countries, birth rates are declining, leading policymakers to sound the alarm over the potential for &#8220;population collapse&#8221;. In an attempt to mitigate the demographic changes, they face, some governments are employing drastic measures to persuade women to have more children. Despite this fact, millions of people around the world are unable to have the number of children they want. In every country, regardless of total fertility rate, the most consequential reproductive decision a human being can make &#8211; when, whether and with whom to have a child &#8211; is being undermined. UNFPA&#8217;s new State of World Population report argues that the real crisis we are facing is not a problem of demographic change: It is a crisis of reproductive agency.<\/p>",

# UN Annual Reports Gallery (alpha)

A minimal website that displays PDF cover pages of UN organization annual reports in a responsive grid gallery.

## Features

- ðŸ“– Display covers of 51+ UN organization annual reports
- ðŸŽ¨ Responsive grid layout that adapts to screen size
- ðŸ”— Direct links to official report pages
- âš¡ Fast loading with optimized images
- ðŸ“± Mobile-friendly design

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Extract PDF covers:**

   The gallery needs cover images for each PDF. You have several options:

   **Option A: Automatic extraction (requires ImageMagick)**

   ```bash
   # Install ImageMagick
   brew install imagemagick  # macOS
   # or
   sudo apt-get install imagemagick  # Ubuntu

   # Run extraction script
   ./scripts/extract-covers.sh
   ```

   **Option B: Manual extraction**

   - Open each PDF in Preview/Adobe Reader
   - Export first page as JPG (600x800px recommended)
   - Place in `public/covers/` with names from `data/reports.json`

   **Option C: View filename mapping**

   ```bash
   npm run cover-instructions
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser

    â””â”€â”€ report.ts         # TypeScript types
```

## Data Structure

Each report in `data/reports.json` contains:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Short Name",
  "fullName": "Full Organization Name",
  "year": "2024",
  "filename": "Original_PDF_Name.pdf",
  "coverImage": "cover-image-name.jpg",
  "website": "https://organization.org/",
  "reportUrl": "https://link-to-report-page.org/"
}
```

## Adding New Reports

1. Add the PDF to the `docs/` folder
2. Add an entry to `data/reports.json`
3. Extract/add the cover image to `public/covers/`
4. Update the website and reportUrl with official links

## Performance

- Uses Next.js Image component for optimized loading
- Responsive images with multiple sizes
- Lazy loading for images below the fold
- Minimal CSS for fast rendering

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Fixes

- make sure to replace img tags with next.js optimized tags again once deployed to server and not static GitHub page
